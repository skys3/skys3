# SkyS3: Implementation Notes

**Implements:** the [task and PR plan](skys3-tasks-plan.md) for the [SkyS3 design](skys3-design.md).

This file records what implementing the plan turned up that the plan and the
design did not anticipate: surprises, wrong assumptions, tooling problems, and
how each one was solved. Design decisions themselves go in the design doc
(plan section 1.1); a note here links to them.

Each task has its own section, so PRs that run in parallel edit different parts
of this file. A task with nothing unexpected keeps "None."

## M0 Foundations

### M0-01 Workspace and CI baseline

- **The bootstrap crate's README include.** `src/lib.rs` used the repository
  README as its crate docs through `include_str!("../README.md")`. Moving the
  crate to `crates/skys3/` changes the relative path to `../../../README.md`,
  and the package's `readme` key to `../../README.md`; `license-file` is
  inherited from `[workspace.package]`, which Cargo rebases per crate.
- **`cargo-deny` and the project's own license.** The workspace crates are
  licensed through `LICENSE` (FSL-1.1-ALv2), which is not on the dependency
  allowlist. They are marked `publish = false` and `deny.toml` sets
  `[licenses.private] ignore = true`, so the allowlist applies only to
  dependencies. `allow-wildcard-paths = true` lets workspace crates depend on
  each other by path without a version.
- **Duplicate-version bans.** `multiple-versions = "deny"` is strict: large
  dependency trees (the AWS SDK, `hyper`) usually carry some duplicates. A PR
  that cannot avoid one adds a `skip` entry to `deny.toml` with the reason,
  rather than weakening the ban.

### M0-02 Core types

- **Bucket IDs cannot be S3 bucket names.** The plan has M0-03 validate
  "cluster and bucket ID lengths" in the configuration, which reads as if the
  bucket ID were the configured bucket name. S3 names run to 63 bytes, and
  the write identity leaves 49 bytes for the cluster and bucket IDs
  together. The bucket ID is therefore a separate ID, assigned at creation
  and never reused (design §4.1), at most 25 bytes; cluster IDs are at most
  24 (§7.2). Never reusing it also closes a hole: a bucket deleted and
  recreated over the same remote, with shard epochs starting again, could
  otherwise produce a write identity that an old remote object already
  carries, and the 412 check would take that object for its own write.
  M0-03 validates `cluster_id` with `ClusterId::new`; bucket IDs are
  validated where they are assigned and when registers are read. The plan's
  M0-03 entry and section 14 row now say so.
- **The 96-byte reservation leaves out the metadata key.** S3 counts both
  keys and values against the 2 KiB user-metadata limit, so the identity
  needs 105 bytes: `skys3-wid` plus a 96-byte value. The design (§7.2) now
  says so, and `WriteIdentity::METADATA_RESERVED_BYTES` holds the figure.
  The plan's M1 user-metadata item said 96; it now names the constant.
- **Coordinator lease renewals must change the ETag.** A candidate takes
  over after seeing the same lease ETag for long enough (§6.7). S3 ETags are
  content hashes, so a renewal that rewrote identical bytes would look like
  no renewal. The fresh `proposal_id` in every write changes the bytes;
  §6.7 now states it.
- **Members may outnumber `replicas`.** A rebalance promotes the new member
  before removing the old one (§6.7), so `ShardConfig` validation does not
  bound the member count by `replicas`.
- **Fuzz targets before the fuzz CI job.** Rule 1.1 wants a `cargo-fuzz`
  target with every parser of untrusted input; write identities read back
  from remote metadata and quoted ETags from remote responses qualify. The
  targets `types_write_identity` and `types_etag` live in `fuzz/`, a crate
  with its own empty `[workspace]` table, so the stable workspace never
  builds it and needs no `exclude`. The targets keep
  `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`: the `#[no_mangle]` export that `fuzz_target!`
  generates comes from an external macro, which the lint does not report
  (found in M0-06; the first version of this crate wrongly said otherwise).
  Both targets build with
  `cargo +nightly fuzz build` and ran 30 s each without findings; CI runs
  them once M1-01 adds the fuzz smoke job. The 412 check itself still
  compares bytes (`WriteIdentity::matches`) rather than parsing.

### M0-03 Configuration

None.

### M0-04 Disk and clock abstractions

- **`syn` 2 and 3 in one tree.** `tokio-macros` 2.7.2 moved to `syn` 3, while
  `tracing-attributes` (through `turmoil`'s `tracing`) and `zerocopy-derive`
  (through `rand`) still use `syn` 2, which `multiple-versions = "deny"`
  rejects. `turmoil` enables Tokio's `macros` feature, so it cannot be turned
  off. Pinning `tokio-macros` 2.7.1 (the last release on `syn` 2) worked for
  this branch alone, but a trial merge with M0-02 and M0-06 showed it does
  not hold: `serde`, `thiserror`, and `prometheus-client`'s derive are on
  `syn` 3 too. `deny.toml` therefore skips `syn@2` with the reason, both
  versions being build-time only, and the lock takes `tokio-macros` 2.7.2.
  The skip goes once `tracing-attributes` and `zerocopy-derive` move to
  `syn` 3.
- **`rand` 0.9, not 0.10.** `turmoil` 0.7.2 depends on `rand` 0.9, so the
  workspace uses 0.9 as well to avoid a second copy of `rand` and
  `getrandom`. For the same reason `tempfile` is used without its default
  `getrandom` feature, which would pull in `getrandom` 0.4.
- **`turmoil`'s own file system is not used.** `turmoil` 0.7 has an
  `unstable-fs` feature: a `std::fs` shim with crash semantics. It is
  unstable, simulates at the `std::fs` level rather than behind a trait that
  also has a real implementation on a blocking pool, and its worker-thread
  context draws from `ThreadRng`, which a seed cannot replay. `SimDisk` in
  `skys3-io` implements the `Disk` trait instead.
- **Simulated time is per host.** `turmoil` runs each host on its own paused
  Tokio runtime, so `tokio::time::Instant` is that host's simulated time.
  `MonotonicClock` builds on it and adds drift and an origin, which means a
  node must create its clock inside its host software (`NodeClock::start`),
  not in the test driver.
- **One open file per segment on the real disk.** A first version kept each
  handle's length separately, so a second `open` of a file did not see
  appends made through the first. `RealDisk` now keeps a registry of open
  files by name and returns the same open file to every `open`.
- **Races in the open-file registry.** Review found that the registry's
  first version raced: between `remove`'s unlink and its registry update, a
  concurrent `create` of the same name could register the new file, whose
  entry `remove` then deleted, so a later `open` made a second open file with
  its own length and appends could overlap. A stress test reproduced it
  reliably. `create`, `open`, and `remove` now hold one async lock per disk
  across the system call and the registry update. `open` always opens the
  file system's file and shares a registered file only if its device and
  inode match, so a stale entry is never reused for a replaced file.
  Entries are weak, so closing the last handle closes the file. `SimDisk`
  already had these semantics: its operations run under one lock without
  awaiting.
- **Finding the replay command.** Cargo sets `CARGO_PKG_NAME` for test
  processes, the test binary is named `<target>-<hash>`, and the test harness
  names each test's thread after the test, including with
  `--test-threads=1`. The runner builds
  `SKYS3_SIM_SEED=<seed> cargo test -p <package> --test <target> -- <test> --exact`
  from these, and a test checks the exact output.

### M0-05 Simulated S3 store

- **The object-store trait needed a home before its client.** The flusher
  (M1-16), the remote client (M1-15), and the S3 control store (M2-04) must
  share one trait that the simulator implements without either depending on
  the other. `skys3-remote` is created now holding only the `ObjectStore`
  trait and its request, response, metadata, and error types (plan section
  4 updated); M1-15 adds the AWS SDK client and the probe to it. Its tests
  that use `SimS3` must be integration tests: `skys3-sim` depends on
  `skys3-remote`, so a unit test would see two copies of the trait.
- **`If-Match` on a missing key is 404, not 412.** AWS answers a
  conditional write whose `If-Match` finds no current object with `404
  NoSuchKey`, which the §7.2 recovery rule did not cover, and a retried
  `CompleteMultipartUpload` whose first attempt landed gets `404
  NoSuchUpload`. Design §7.2 now treats both like a 412. The AWS
  documentation was not reachable from the build environment, and older
  pages for conditional deletes described `204` for a missing key, so M1-26
  should confirm the behavior against AWS for each operation.
- **409 has no precise AWS definition.** AWS documents
  `ConditionalRequestConflict` only as a race with a concurrent write. The
  simulator makes a conditional write fail with it when another write to
  the key is applied during its request delay, so conflicts appear only with
  delays (random ones, or a scripted `Fault::Delay` in unit tests). Design
  §7.2 now says how the flusher handles it.
- **Lost `CreateMultipartUpload` responses orphan uploads.** The simulation
  scenario found that such an upload's ID never reaches the flusher, so the
  abort path of §7.3 cannot find it. Design §7.3 now names the lifecycle
  rule as its only backstop; a `ListMultipartUploads` scan would need a new
  trait method, left to M1-16b or M4-02.
- **Ignored versus rejected preconditions.** Providers without support may
  apply the write unconditionally or answer `501 NotImplemented`. The
  simulator models both per operation (`ConditionalSupport`), so the
  capability probe (M1-15) can be tested against each; design §7.2 records
  that both count as unsupported.
- **Nothing to fuzz.** Ranges are the typed `ByteRange`, and continuation
  tokens are keys into a table of issued tokens, so the simulator parses no
  strings. `ByteRange::resolve` has a proptest against a byte-by-byte model.
- **Listing edge cases the first version got wrong.** Review found two:
  a `ListParts` page with `max_parts = 0` was marked truncated without a
  marker, so a paginator looped forever, and a common prefix at or before
  `StartAfter` was returned when keys under it sorted after it (keys `b/1`,
  `b/3`, `StartAfter = b/2` returned `b/`, which S3 leaves out). Listing now
  compares each entry, key or common prefix, with the page's start position
  and the last entry returned, and a limit of zero returns an empty page
  that is not truncated for both operations, as S3 does for `max-keys=0`.
  Property tests page through both listings with page sizes from 0 up and
  compare them with a reference model. The first property test did not
  find the `StartAfter` bug in 256 cases: positions inside a common prefix
  were too rare, so the generator now biases toward them.
- **Simulation tests moved into a directory.** `tests/simulation.rs` became
  `tests/simulation/{main,disk,s3}.rs`, keeping the target name, so CI's
  `--test simulation` and the replay commands are unchanged.

### M0-06 Observability scaffolding

None.
