# SkyS3: Implementation Notes

**Implements:** the [task and PR plan](skys3-tasks-plan.md) for the [SkyS3 design](skys3-design.md).

This file records what implementing the plan turned up that the plan and the
design did not anticipate: surprises, wrong assumptions, tooling problems, and
how each one was solved. Design decisions themselves go in the design doc
(plan section 1.1); a note here links to them.

Each task has its own section, so PRs that run in parallel edit different parts
of this file. A task with nothing unexpected keeps "None."

## M0 Foundations

### M0-01 Workspace and CI baseline

- **The bootstrap crate's README include.** `src/lib.rs` used the repository
  README as its crate docs through `include_str!("../README.md")`. Moving the
  crate to `crates/skys3/` changes the relative path to `../../../README.md`,
  and the package's `readme` key to `../../README.md`; `license-file` is
  inherited from `[workspace.package]`, which Cargo rebases per crate.
- **`cargo-deny` and the project's own license.** The workspace crates are
  licensed through `LICENSE` (FSL-1.1-ALv2), which is not on the dependency
  allowlist. They are marked `publish = false` and `deny.toml` sets
  `[licenses.private] ignore = true`, so the allowlist applies only to
  dependencies. `allow-wildcard-paths = true` lets workspace crates depend on
  each other by path without a version.
- **Duplicate-version bans.** `multiple-versions = "deny"` is strict: large
  dependency trees (the AWS SDK, `hyper`) usually carry some duplicates. A PR
  that cannot avoid one adds a `skip` entry to `deny.toml` with the reason,
  rather than weakening the ban.

### M0-02 Core types

None.

### M0-03 Configuration

None.

### M0-04 Disk and clock abstractions

- **`syn` 2 and 3 in one tree.** `tokio-macros` 2.7.2 moved to `syn` 3, while
  `tracing-attributes` (through `turmoil`'s `tracing`) and `zerocopy-derive`
  (through `rand`) still use `syn` 2, which `multiple-versions = "deny"`
  rejects. `turmoil` enables Tokio's `macros` feature, so it cannot be turned
  off. `Cargo.lock` pins `tokio-macros` 2.7.1, the last release on `syn` 2
  (Tokio 1.53 accepts `~2.7.0`). Dependabot will propose 2.7.2 and
  `cargo deny` will fail that PR; take it once the `syn` 2 users move, or add
  a `skip` then.
- **`rand` 0.9, not 0.10.** `turmoil` 0.7.2 depends on `rand` 0.9, so the
  workspace uses 0.9 as well to avoid a second copy of `rand` and
  `getrandom`. For the same reason `tempfile` is used without its default
  `getrandom` feature, which would pull in `getrandom` 0.4.
- **`turmoil`'s own file system is not used.** `turmoil` 0.7 has an
  `unstable-fs` feature: a `std::fs` shim with crash semantics. It is
  unstable, simulates at the `std::fs` level rather than behind a trait that
  also has a real implementation on a blocking pool, and its worker-thread
  context draws from `ThreadRng`, which a seed cannot replay. `SimDisk` in
  `skys3-io` implements the `Disk` trait instead.
- **Simulated time is per host.** `turmoil` runs each host on its own paused
  Tokio runtime, so `tokio::time::Instant` is that host's simulated time.
  `MonotonicClock` builds on it and adds drift and an origin, which means a
  node must create its clock inside its host software (`NodeClock::start`),
  not in the test driver.
- **One open file per segment on the real disk.** A first version kept each
  handle's length separately, so a second `open` of a file did not see
  appends made through the first. `RealDisk` now keeps a registry of open
  files by name and returns the same open file to every `open`.
- **Finding the replay command.** Cargo sets `CARGO_PKG_NAME` for test
  processes, the test binary is named `<target>-<hash>`, and the test harness
  names each test's thread after the test, including with
  `--test-threads=1`. The runner builds
  `SKYS3_SIM_SEED=<seed> cargo test -p <package> --test <target> -- <test> --exact`
  from these, and a test checks the exact output.
